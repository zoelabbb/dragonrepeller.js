## Welcome to RPG - Dragon Repeller
`JavaScript` is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with `HTML` and `CSS`. All modern browsers support `JavaScript`.

In this repository, I learn how to build a Role Playing Game and I learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Role Playing Game.

## What I'll Learn:
- Learn how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.

## Technology Used:
- JavaScript: The primary programming language for game logic and user interaction.
- HTML5 & CSS3: For layout and game appearance design.
